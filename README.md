This program is an implementation of a basic statistical analysis on a fixed-size dataset. It calculates and displays the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values of an array of unsigned char data. Additionally, it provides functions to print the dataset, sort it in ascending order using bubble sort, and then print the sorted values in a tabular format. The code is designed as part of an embedded software learning assignment (C1M1) and demonstrates fundamental concepts such as array manipulation, loops, and basic statistics in C programming.
